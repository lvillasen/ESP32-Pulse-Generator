# ESP32 Simple Pulse Generator

This app illustrates the concept of pulse-with modulation (PWM) using an ESP32 microcontroller. The ESP32 can be programmed with the firmware provided to generate pulses of variable widths on two GPIO pins of the ESP32 using a serial port. To program the ESP32 microcontroller you can use the Arduino IDE software.

The LED PWM Controller is designed primarily to drive LEDs, however you can drive any device, like a laser diode, or you can connect an oscilloscope to display the signal. 


## Usage
